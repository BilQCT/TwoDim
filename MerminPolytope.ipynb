    "# Magic Square\n",
    "\n",
    "The Peres--Mermin square, also known as the magic square, is a construction providing the simplest proof of contextuality. In the original version nine quantum observables are organized into a $3\\times 3$ square grid such that the operators in each row and column pairwise commute. A further constraint is imposed on the product of the observables in each context (row and column). We will require that the product of the observables in each row and column gives $-\\mathbb{1}$ and $\\mathbb{1}$, respectively. A solution satisfying these constraints are given by the non-local Pauli operators $A\\otimes B$ where $A,B\\in \\lbrace X,Y,Z \\rbrace$. However, it is well-known that these constraints cannot be satisfies by the eigenvalues $\\pm 1$. This is the Peres--Mermin paradox, the simplest proof of contextuality.\n",
    "\n",
    "A topological way of describing the paradox is achieved using the framework of simplicial distributions. In the theory of simplicial distributions spaces are represented by simplicial sets. In this framework the square grid is represented by a torus consisting of triangles for each context. More generally, two-dimensional spaces, such as a torus, are constructed from triangles glued along their faces.  There are three faces of a triangle $\\sigma$ denoted by $d_i\\sigma$ where $i=0,1,2$. In our case the torus $X$ consists of six triangles denoted by $\\sigma_1,\\cdots,\\sigma_6$ glued along their faces.   \n",
