This is not particularly restrictive as it is a basic fact about simplicial distributions that simplicial distributions restricted to one-dimensional spaces yield only \"classical\" distributions, which are not particularly interesting.\n",

The problem of converting from $H$ to $V$ representation is called the vertex (facet) enumeration problem. The polytope $P_X$ can be defined in its $H$-representation as follows. For $(a,b)\\in \\mathbb{Z}_2^2$ and non-degenerate $2$-simplex $\\sigma$ let us consider the distribution $p_\\sigma$ on each triangle. Since we work with the semi-ring $\\mathbb{R}_{\\geq 0}$ we require that $p_\\sigma^{ab}\\geq 0$ for all $(a,b)\\in \\mathbb{Z}_2^2$ and non-degenerate $2$-simplex $\\sigma$.

If a simplex $\\sigma_n \\in X_n$ is in the image of a degeneracy map acting on a non-degenerate simplex $\\sigma_{n-1}$, i.e. $\\sigma = s_j(\\sigma_{n-1})$, then this degenerate simplex is not pictured in the geometric realization of $X$.

Degeneracies solve this issue since the simplicial set for $\\Delta^0$ includes $n$-simplices at every level $(\\Delta^0)_n$ that are just images of the non-degenerate point $c\\in (\\Delta^0)_0$ under the degeneracy map. By mapping a non-degenerate $1$-simplex $\\tau\\in (\\Delta^1)_1$ to a degenerate $1$-simplex $s_j(c)\\in (\\Delta^0)_1$ we implement the desired collapse since degenerate simplices do not appear in the geometrical realization of $\\Delta^0$.-->\n",
